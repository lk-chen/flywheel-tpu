# FlyWheel on TPU v7x

The benchmarks in the [README](README.md) were measured on v6e. This page has
the softmax attention benchmark on v7x, measured the same way and on the same
stack, `jax[tpu]==0.11.0` and `libtpu==0.0.44`.

## Softmax attention

Causal prefill on one v7x core, head_dim 256, B = 1, for 32:32 (MHA)
and 32:4 (GQA) heads. The rows under each sequence length are our speedup
over [RPA v3](https://github.com/vllm-project/tpu-inference/tree/4420cae/tpu_inference/kernels/ragged_paged_attention/v3), [batched RPA](https://github.com/vllm-project/tpu-inference/tree/4420cae/tpu_inference/kernels/experimental/batched_rpa) and [Splash Attention](https://github.com/openxla/tokamax/tree/84e5f36/tokamax/_src/ops/experimental/tpu/splash_attention).

![Attention kernel throughput on v7x](assert/softmax_attn_benchmark_v7x.png)

Every number comes from
[`benchmarks/softmax_attention/`](benchmarks/softmax_attention/), with the
block, the timing and the trace split described in the
[README](README.md#softmax-attention). Four things differ on v7x:

- **One device is one core.** A v7x chip has two TensorCores and JAX lists
  each as a device, so the `jax.devices()[0]` the benchmark runs on is half a
  chip. The dashed line is that core's bf16 peak,
  `pltpu.get_tpu_info().bf16_ops_per_second`.
- **The block configs are tuned on v7x.** A v7x core has 64 MiB of VMEM, less
  than the configs searched on v6e need: RPA v3's v6e entries run out of VMEM
  on 15 of the 16 cells, and Splash Attention's at 64K and 128K. So
  [`tune_blocks.py`](benchmarks/softmax_attention/tune_blocks.py) searched
  every kernel per cell on v7x, into `rpa_tuned_v7x.json`,
  `batched_rpa_tuned_v7x.json`, `splash_tuned_v7x.json` and the `"TPU v7"`
  section of [`tuned_configs.json`](flywheel_tpu/tuned_configs.json), and
  `attention_block.py` reads the tables of the chip it runs on. At 32:32 RPA
  v3's own v7 default formula runs out of VMEM as well, on every cell; what
  fits is `[128, 256, 128, 256]`, which is its tuned config from 1K to 128K.
  flywheel's analytic defaults were already close: tuning moved its kernel by
  about 2% at the median, and by 22% at 1K for 32:32, where it folds heads.
- **The trace split reads the TensorCore only.** On v7x XLA offloads RPA v3's
  relayout copies to the SparseCores, which adds their processes to the
  trace. `segments.py` leaves them out: the TensorCore's wait for them is
  already on its own timeline, in the `layout` segment.
- **Batched RPA is a fourth backend, and only runs to 16K.** It is
  tpu-inference's experimental batched kernel, loaded from the same pinned
  submodule as RPA v3 (`4420cae`; the directory is unchanged on `main` as of
  2026-09-30) and given the inputs and paged KV cache RPA v3 gets. Its kernel
  segment is its `RPAm-...` Pallas call; the `rpa_metadata_schedule` kernel
  it runs first, which upstream amortizes across layers, lands in `other`
  (0.17 ms at 1K and 11.4 ms at 16K for 32:32). On v7x:
  - the block sizes it calculates for itself run out of VMEM on every 32:32
    cell, so it runs on tuned ones here, as the others do;
  - on the 16-token KV pages vLLM uses past 8K it halts the core
    (`E0200: RuntimeUnexpectedCoreHalt`), so its 16K cell, marked \*, runs
    on 256-token pages, which its table records and `attention_block.py`
    applies, while RPA v3 stays on 16;
  - at 32K it runs on 256-token pages but its output does not match exact
    causal attention, and at 64K and 128K no config we tried runs, so those
    cells are empty.

To reproduce the figure, sequentially on a v7x VM:

```bash
git submodule update --init third_party/tpu-inference third_party/tokamax
IMPLS="rpa batched_rpa splash flywheel" \
    benchmarks/softmax_attention/attention_block.sh results/benchmark/softmax_attention_v7x
```

The batched RPA cells from 32K up have no table entry and fail; the script
logs them and goes on.

### Tuning the block configs

`tune_blocks.py` searches one cell at a time, timing the kernel alone. From
the kernel's own default and its v6e entry it sweeps one config field at a
time, keeps the fastest and repeats until a pass gains under 1%, then times
the fastest few again with the benchmark's protocol. A candidate that aborts
the process, hangs or halts the core is logged before it runs, so running the
same command again resumes past it:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. uv run --no-sync python benchmarks/softmax_attention/tune_blocks.py \
    --impl rpa --heads 32 --heads-k 4 --head-dim 256 --seq 8192 \
    --output results/tune/softmax_attention
```

Searches of different cells can run side by side, one per chip, with
`TPU_VISIBLE_CHIPS=<chip> TPU_CHIPS_PER_HOST_BOUNDS=1,1,1 TPU_HOST_BOUNDS=1,1,1`
in front of the command. `--page-size` searches RPA v3 or batched RPA on a KV
page size other than vLLM's default, which is how the batched RPA 16K cells
were searched (`--page-size 256`). Once every cell has a best config, write
the tables:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. uv run --no-sync python benchmarks/softmax_attention/tune_blocks.py \
    --collect results/tune/softmax_attention --device-tag v7x
```

## Not on v7x yet

The fused GDN and KDA kernels and `flash_attn_varlen_func` do not compile on
v7x with this stack. Mosaic stops at
`E2003: CompileTimeMosaicUnprovenMemoryAccessAlignment: cannot statically
prove that index in dimension 0 is a multiple of 16` (dimension 1 for varlen):
v7x tiles bf16 VMEM in 16 rows, and these kernels address it in 8-row slabs.
So the README's linear attention benchmark has no flywheel number on v7x. Its
`gdn_v3` baseline runs, at 6.4 to 9.0 M tokens/s for n_v = 16.
